## Overview

### The challenge

The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) was to build out the profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

### Built with

HTML5 + CSS | Flexbox | CSS Grid using a mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

Major learnings while working on this project were:

- Responsive background images can be a bit tricky.
- Calling `margin-top` can move the affected element above the preceeding elements, if the value is sufficient.
- `overflow: hidden` is another good alternative to creating rounded corners on a `div` that contains other `div`s.

### Continued development

This solution is still a WIP, for the following reasons:

- There's a weird spacing around the profile picture and it's border.
- The solution is not elegantly translayed on a Galaxy Fold as the `@media` queries do not accommodate this use case.
- The background images are missing.

Attempting this challenge highlighted some areas I would like to continue perfecting:

- Creating responsive background images.
